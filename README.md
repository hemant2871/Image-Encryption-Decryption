# Image-Encryption-Decryption
This Java project encrypts and decrypts image files using a key-based XOR algorithm. It features a user-friendly GUI built with Java Swing, uses Threads to keep the interface responsive during processing, and applies File I/O for reading and writing image data. Ideal for learning basic cryptography, GUI design, and multithreading in Java.
