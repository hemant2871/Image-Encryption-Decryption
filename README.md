## 🔐 Image Encryption and Decryption using Java (Swing GUI)

This project demonstrates a simple **Image Encryption and Decryption** application built using **Java Swing**. It provides a GUI-based interface where users can upload an image, encrypt it using a key-based algorithm, and decrypt it back to its original form.

---

## 🖥️ Built With

- **Java**
- **Swing (Java GUI Library)**

---

## 📌 Features

- 📁 Upload image through GUI
- 🔐 Encrypt image pixels with a custom logic and key
- 🔓 Decrypt image to its original form using the same key
- 🖼️ Supports popular image formats like `.jpg`, `.png`
- 🧠 Simple and intuitive Swing-based UI

## 🧩 Project Structure

```bash
├── ImageOperation.java    # Entry point for the application
├── GUI.java               # Swing-based user interface
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```
## 🚀 How to Run
### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/hemant2871/Image-Encryption-Decryption.git
cd Image-Encryption-Decryption
```
### 2. Compile the Code
You can compile it using any IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse) or through the terminal:
```
javac *.java
```
### 3. Run the Application
```
java Main
```
##🧠 How It Works
1.  The user selects an image through the Swing interface.

2.  Each pixel of the image is read and its color values are transformed using a key.

3.  The encryption is done by shifting pixel values based on the logic implemented.

4.  The same process is reversed in decryption using the same key.
